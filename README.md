# Connect4Multiplayer
Connect 4 Multiplayer begins with a start screen showing a screenshot of the game along with the logo. Players can either start the game from here or go to the instruction page and from there and start the game. The game itself involves choosing between the blue or red team from a drop-down menu with game updating for each player in real-time. Then, each player takes turns filling a slot on the board. The first player to connect four tokens horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. If more than two people join the game the rest of the players will be observers. Additionally, the game features a display of the current player as a guide throughout the game.
